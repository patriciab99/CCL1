Making the diary for daily documentation on GitHub.
Yesterday I did mostly research to find tutorials that might help during the process of making the project.
I compared how the tutorials differ from one another and what different methods were used to achieve certain things in the code.
I tried to combine aspects from multiple tutorials to achieve a very basic prototype with a movable rectangle that the player can move left and right (aka the animal later on).
I then also tried to generate objects (rectangles) falling from the sky.

Things that I did today:
- try to make the object emojis
- try to make the objects so that I can attach a picture to them
- make a point score
- make a health score
- generate trash objects
- connect food and trash objects to the point and health system.
