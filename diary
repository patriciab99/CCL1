Making the diary for daily documentation on GitHub.
Yesterday I did mostly research to find tutorials that might help during the process of making the project.
I compared how the tutorials differ from one another and what different methods were used to achieve certain things in the code.
I tried to combine aspects from multiple tutorials to achieve a very basic prototype with a movable rectangle that the player can move left and right (aka the animal later on).
I then also tried to generate objects (rectangles) falling from the sky.
